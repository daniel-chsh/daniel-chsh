> I like to dive into a business problem and get to the bottom of it, find patterns and solve the problem. I track and explore new approaches, try to put them into practice and implement them into existing infrastructure. I am a member of the Open Data Science community. I develop a community of data scientists in a company and sometimes give lectures.
 
Skills: Python / Machine Learning / MLOps / SQL / Forcasting / AB-tests
